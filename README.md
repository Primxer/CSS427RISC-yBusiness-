The code that contains our final product is the CSS427_Project_Combo Folder.  We added both the Mega and Uno code into one file for simplicity. The folder should contain all the required libraries but be sure to install the others listed below in the Ardunino IDE.

LIBARIES: \
#include <Adafruit_MPL3115A2.h> \
#include <Servo.h> \
#include <Wire.h> \ 
#include <SPI.h> \ 
#include <Math.h> \
#include <Adafruit_RGBLCDShield.h> \
